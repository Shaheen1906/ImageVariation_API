# ImageVariation_API
This project helps to generate 4 image variation with Authentication.

I have used DRF(Django REST Framework) for creating variation API.

In this you just have to Logging and upload image and click on post.
It will generate the 4 different variations of the image like (thumbnail,large,medium,grayscale) with different different sizes.
